This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About
DevLinks is a purely recreational and personal project. In each tab, you will find three (3) of my top tool choices for the subject.
## Where the idea came from?
When I started as a web developer, I used to spend hours searching for tools that would improve my workflows. But as time passed, I was able to distinguish what would be useful and what was just a distraction, so I decided to gather all here for you.
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
